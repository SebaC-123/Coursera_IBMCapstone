    "For many people, food occupies an important place in the daily routine, more than anything on weekends. What better place to have a restaurant than in a world gastronomic center like the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. As the Gastronomic Capital of Ibero-America 2017, Buenos Aires has a proposal of inexhaustible cuisine and gastronomic poles to taste the best recipes. A warm stew, a delicious barbecue or a delicious hot chocolate with churros are options to regain energy after a day full of activities on this winter vacation. It is not only the capital of Argentina, but it is one of the largest cities in South America due to the concentration of inhabitants it has."

It is also intended to analyze the different gastronomic items in the areas, in order to be able to select a business that has a comparative advantage over the rest. In other words, the problem will be selecting a good location and a strategic restaurant item."

Then we will get the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoods using Python Geocoder package which will give us the latitude and longitude coordinates from the neighborhoods.\n",
    "After that, we will use Foursquare API to get the venue data from those neighborhoods. Foursquare has one of the largest database of 105+ million places and is used by over 150,000 developers. Foursquare API will provide many categories of the venue data, we are particularly interested in the restaurants information. In this project, we will use many data science skills likeweb scraping, working with API, data cleaning, data wrangling, clustering and map visualization."
